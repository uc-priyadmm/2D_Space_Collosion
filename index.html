    <p>An elastic collision is a collision in which there is no net loss in kinetic energy in the system as a result of the collision. Both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved quantities in elastic collisions. In reality, examples of perfectly elastic collisions are not part of our everyday experience. Some collisions between atoms in gases are examples of perfectly elastic collisions. However, there are some examples of collisions in mechanics where the energy lost can be negligible. These collisions can be considered elastic, even though they are not perfectly elastic. Collisions of rigid billiard balls or the balls in a Newton's cradle are two such examples. - Khan Academy

    <p>Thanks Professor, I never though I could do this before taking this class.</p>
