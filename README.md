# 2D_Space_Collosion

Sometimes the particles go crazy if you keep the webpage up for too long. Refresh in that case.

Simulation of perfectly elastic collisions in 2D space. The program is a simulation of 2D collision, I was curios if I could implement some big boy logic into my programs and this is a humble attempt. I would wish to add differnt sized particles with different shapes too. The program runs on monkey logic :

1) Particle is generated


3) Particle in 2D space,has x and y. We are only working with particle postion, mass is constant and speed is constant at the starts but the speeds are added or shared at the time of collision, not really. EXPLAINED LATER 


Particles go whooooo. ( in x and y cordinates)

The actually program is far complex than that, using canvas we are able to detect particle postion in all directions by mapping the x and y cordinates to "to-x and to-y" and generate an animation. The code uses a closed system wih 4 walls and particles can collide between one another or the walls. This is just a very stupid version of https://github.com/mreinstein/collision-2d and many other projects which really go into the detail of these things. I beleive I have a basic undertsanding of this topic.
